# Dermatology diseases classification

In this project, it was used principal component analysis (PCA), cross-validation and machine learning classification algorithms, to classified 6 different dermatological pathologies. 

#### Data
Each line corresponds to a patient and contains 34 attributes and their class (the last value of each sample). Some samples include invalid values represented by the '?'. The complete description of this dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dermatology


#### Technologies used:

- python
- pandas, numpy
- PCA analysis, cross-validation
- sklearn, scipy
- classification algorithms: K-Nearest neighbours (KNN), suport vector machine (SVM), decision tree, gaussian baive bayes
- matplotlib, seaborn
- jupyter notebooks, anaconda
